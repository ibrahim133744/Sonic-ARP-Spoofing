## ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ CRITICAL WARNING & USAGE ADVISORY ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

**This tool is intended STRICTLY for educational purposes and technical demonstration ONLY.**

**DO NOT use this software on any network without the explicit, PRIOR, WRITTEN PERMISSION of the network owner.** Unauthorized use of ARP spoofing tools is **ILLEGAL** in most jurisdictions and can cause significant network disruption. Such actions may lead to severe consequences, including **legal prosecution, financial penalties, and account suspension.**

**The developer (ibrahim) assumes ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY for any damage, disruption, or legal issues arising from the misuse of this software.** This code is shared "as-is" as a demonstration project. **USE ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK** and only within legally permitted and controlled environments.

## Description

SonicARP is a project showcasing the implementation of ARP spoofing using Python. It utilizes **Scapy** for low-level network packet crafting and manipulation, and **Tkinter** (with `ttk` and `ttkthemes`) for the graphical user interface.

The tool provides basic functionalities for:
*   Attempting automatic detection of local network parameters (IP, MAC, Gateway, Network Range).
*   Scanning the local network using ARP requests to discover active devices.
*   Performing an **automatic ARP spoofing attack** against **all** discovered devices (excluding the user's machine and the gateway).
*   Optionally poisoning the gateway's ARP cache as well (for potential Man-in-the-Middle setup analysis - actual interception requires separate tools).
*   Attempting to restore the ARP tables of targeted devices upon stopping the attack.
*   Logging activities within the GUI.

This project was developed primarily for learning purposes related to network programming, packet manipulation with Scapy, and GUI development with Tkinter. It is **not intended as a polished, production-ready utility** but rather as a functional demonstration of the concepts involved.

## Prerequisites

Before running SonicARP, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Python 3.x:** Recommended version 3.7 or higher.
2.  **pip:** The Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
3.  **Npcap:** **ESSENTIAL** packet capture library for Windows. Scapy relies on this for sending and receiving raw packets.
    *   Download from: [https://npcap.com/](https://npcap.com/)
    *   **During installation:** Make sure to check the option **"Support WinPcap API-compatible mode"**.
4.  **Administrator Privileges:** The script or the compiled `.exe` **MUST** be executed with administrator rights to allow Scapy access to raw sockets and network interfaces.

## Installation

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    *   Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vas_username/SonicARP.git` (Zamenite URL pravim!)
    *   Or download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.
2.  **Navigate to Directory:**
    Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the project directory: `cd path/to/SonicARP`
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It's highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment (`venv`).
    ```bash
    # Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate virtual environment
    # Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install required packages
    pip install scapy ttkthemes ipaddress
    ```
    *(Note: `ipaddress` is built-in with Python 3.3+ but listing it doesn't hurt).*
4.  **Install Npcap:** Make sure Npcap is installed as described in the Prerequisites section.

## Usage Guide

1.  **Run as Administrator:**
    *   **Windows:** Right-click on your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell) and select "Run as administrator".
    *   **Linux/macOS:** Use `sudo`.
2.  **Launch the Script:**
    From the administrator terminal within the project directory (and with the virtual environment activated, if used):
    ```bash
    python sonic_arp.py
    ```
    *(Replace `sonic_arp.py` with the actual name of your Python script if different).*
3.  **Interface Overview:**
    *   **Controls (Left Panel):** Buttons for scanning, starting/stopping the attack, and the gateway poisoning option. Also includes the critical warning.
    *   **Found Devices (Top Right):** Listbox where discovered devices will appear after a scan.
    *   **Activity Log (Bottom Right):** Shows status messages, errors, and attack progress.
    *   **Status Bar (Bottom):** Displays the current status and developer credit.
4.  **Workflow:**
    *   **Step 1: Scan Network:** Click `ðŸ“¡ Scan Network`. The tool will try to find devices on your local network using ARP. Wait for the scan to complete. Found devices (potential targets) will populate the list.
    *   **Step 2 (Optional): Poison Gateway:** If you intend to attempt a Man-in-the-Middle attack (requires separate tools for traffic analysis), check the `Poison Gateway (MitM)` box. By default, SonicARP only poisons the clients *about* the gateway.
    *   **Step 3: Start Attack:** Click `ðŸš€ Start AUTO Attack`. **WARNING:** This will immediately begin sending ARP spoof packets to **ALL** devices listed in the "Found Devices" list.
    *   **Step 4: Stop Attack:** When finished, click `âœ… Stop Attack`. The tool will cease sending spoof packets and attempt to send corrective ARP packets to restore the ARP tables of the targeted devices and the gateway (if poisoned).

## Building the .exe (Optional)

If you want a standalone executable (requires PyInstaller):

1.  **Install PyInstaller:** `pip install pyinstaller`
2.  **Prepare Icon:** Place an icon file (e.g., `sonic_icon.ico`) in the project directory.
3.  **Run PyInstaller:** From an **administrator** terminal in the project directory:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon="sonic_icon.ico" --name="SonicARP_by_ibrahim" sonic_arp.py
    ```
    *(Adjust icon and script names as needed).*
4.  **Find Executable:** The `.exe` file will be located in the `dist` sub-directory.
5.  **IMPORTANT:** Even when using the `.exe`, the target computer **must still have Npcap installed correctly**, and the `.exe` **must be run as administrator**. Antivirus software might also flag the executable.
