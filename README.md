## Description

SonicARP [v1.3] is a project demonstrating ARP spoofing using Python. It utilizes **Scapy** for network packet manipulation and **Tkinter** (with `ttkthemes`) for the graphical user interface.

**Functionality of this version:**
*   Attempts automatic detection of local network parameters.
*   Scans the local network using ARP requests to discover active devices.
*   Performs an **automatic ARP spoofing attack** against **ALL** discovered devices (excluding the user's machine and the gateway). **Note: This version attacks all found devices automatically, selective targeting is not implemented.**
*   Optionally poisons the gateway's ARP cache as well (for potential MitM setup analysis).
*   Attempts to restore the ARP tables of targeted devices upon stopping the attack.
*   Logs activities within the GUI.
*   Includes a link to the developer's GitHub profile in the status bar.

This project was developed primarily for learning purposes. The source code is made visible for review and demonstration purposes.

## Prerequisites

To run SonicARP [v1.3], you need:

1.  **Npcap Installation:** You **MUST** install the Npcap library first.
    *   Download from: [https://npcap.com/](https://npcap.com/)
    *   **Crucial:** During installation, ensure **"Support WinPcap API-compatible mode"** is **checked**.
2.  **Administrator Privileges:** The executable or script **MUST** be run with administrator rights.
3.  **(If running from source code):** Python 3.x (e.g., 3.7+) and the required libraries (`pip install scapy ttkthemes`).

## Running SonicARP [v1.3]

**Option 1: Using the Pre-compiled Executable (.exe)**

1.  **Download:** Get the `SonicARPSpoofing_by_IBRAHIM.exe` file (or similar name you used).
    *   *(You will need to build this yourself using PyInstaller and the corresponding v1.3 source code. Consider uploading it to GitHub Releases if sharing).*
2.  **Ensure Npcap is installed** (see Prerequisites).
3.  **Run:** Right-click `SonicARPSpoofing_by_IBRAHIM.exe` and select "**Run as administrator**".

**Option 2: Running from Source Code**

1.  **Ensure Prerequisites are met** (Python, pip, Npcap, Admin rights).
2.  **Download/Clone** the source code for this version.
3.  **Install dependencies:** `pip install scapy ttkthemes`
4.  **Run:** Open an **administrator** terminal, navigate to the code directory, and run `python your_script_name_v1.3.py` (replace with your actual filename).

## Usage Guide (v1.3 Interface)

1.  **Scan Network:** Click `ðŸ“¡ Scan Network` to find devices.
2.  **Review Devices:** Found devices (targets) appear in the list. **Remember, clicking Start will attack ALL of them.**
3.  **(Optional) Poison Gateway:** Check the box if desired.
4.  **Start Attack:** Click `ðŸš€ Start AUTO Attack`. The attack on ALL devices begins immediately.
5.  **Stop Attack:** Click `âœ… Stop Attack & Restore` to stop spoofing and attempt ARP table restoration.
